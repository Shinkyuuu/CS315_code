# ♦️ Homework \#1

  ## Header Files
  * stdio.h
  * stdlib.h
  * stdbool.h
  
## Explanation 
* Program that allows the user to create a numerically ordered linked list and delete items within it
<br>
* Inputs are to be <b>Integers</b> accepted continuously until the user types in <b>"0"</b>
* There is no error checking for invalid inputs
<br>
  ◻️ After <b>"0"</b> is inputted, a link list is printed to the screen with the option to delete a node
  * The user can input any integer and if it exists within the linked list, it will be deleted until there are no nodes left

# ♦️ Homework \#2

  ## Header Files
  * stdio.h

## Explanation
* Program that creates a queue data structure with an array with insertion and deletion funcionality
<br>
* The program gives the user 3 options for inputs, <b>i for insert, r for remove, and q for quit</b>
  ◻️ If <b>i</b> is inputted, the user can input an integer into the queue
  <br>
  ◻️ If <b>r</b> is inputted, the oldest integer in the queue will be removed
  <br>
  ◻️ quit is self explanitory

# ♦️ Homework \#3

  ## Header Files
  * stdio.h
  * stdlib.h

## Explanation
* Program that creates a queue with a circular linked list with insertion and removal funcionality
<br>
* Funcionally this program works similarly to that in Homework 2
  * The difference being that <b>Characters</b> are inputted into the queue rather than just <b>Integers</b>
  * The same options are given and they perform the same actions

# ♦️ Homework \#4

  ## Header Files
  * stdio.h
  * stdlib.h
  * ctype.h
  
## Explanation
* Program that creates a binary tree with insertion, searching, and pre/in-order traversal functions
* The binary tree is sorted by the position of the letters of the alphabet
<br>
* The user is first prompted for an input "<b>(I)nsert, (F)ind, (Q)uit</b>"
  ◻️ If <b>i</b> is inputted, the user will be prompted to input a <b>Character</b> (letter of the alphabet) that will act as the node's <b>"key"</b>
  * The user will then be prompted to input the <b>"Key"</b>'s value (<b>String</b>)
  * After the value is entered, the binary tree will be printed to the screen as a Pre- and In-order traversal
  <br>
  ◻️ if <b>f</b> is inputted, the user will be prompted to enter the key of the value they seek to find.
  * Upon entering the <b>key</b>, the associated value will be printed to the screen.
  <br>
  ◻️ Again, quit needs no explanation

# ♦️ Homework \#5

  ## Header Files
  * stdio.h
  * stdlib.h
  
## Explanation
* Program that creates a huffman tree using a little end up heap as an auxilary data structure
<br>
◻️ The user is first prompted to enter a <b>Character</b> and the option of typing <b>"$"</b> to quit
* If the user enters a character, they will then be asked to input said character's frequency (How often it appears in a pretend message)
* After this, the user gets prompted for another <b>Character</b> again
<br>
◻️ If the user inputs <b>"$"</b>, the huffman tree will be printed to the screen as a Pre- and In-order traversal
